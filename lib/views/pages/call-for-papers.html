        <h2>Call for <span class="special-color">Papers</span></h2>

        <div class="theme theme--left">
            <blockquote>We would like to invite you to get involved with our conference. So for this year&#39;s event we decided to do a Call for Papers for two talks.</blockquote>

            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>On the one hand we want to give interested people an opportunity to present their great talk at NightlyBuild. On the other hand we think that this will be an excellent addition to our other talks on that evening.</p>

            <h3>Cool, where do I apply?</h3>
            <p>If you would like to give a talk yourself or you know somebody that knows somebody that is interested in giving a talk, you can send us some details on your topic <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelXGz4CXHMpBL6BZtOQA3pHRH1vL9sHCDOc5AH6EkMbf1Y7g/viewform" target="_blank"><s>via this form</s></a>.</p>

            <h3>What&rsquo;s the main theme again?</h3>
            <p>Our main theme is:&nbsp;
            <p>A web&hellip;</p>
            <p>
            &hellip; for the next generation<br>
                &hellip; for future developers<br>
                &hellip; for everyone<br>
                &hellip; for a better world<br>
                &hellip; seen through time and space.
            </p>

            <p>Talks should be related to that theme if possible. For more details on our theme please head over <a href="https://nightlybuild.io" target="_blank">to our web site</a>.</p>

           <h3>Until when can talks be submitted?</h3>
           <p>The Call for Papers (CfP) will be online for the next couple of weeks and will end on June 30th 2017.</p>

           <h3>What will happen after the CfP phase is over?</h3>
           <ul>
            <li>
                <p>After the CfP phase is over we will discuss all proposed talks within our team to see which one fits best.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Be assured that we will decide solely based on the topic and content&nbsp;of a proposed talk and how it fits our conference and the main theme.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In other words: you don&rsquo;t need to be a well-known speaker. We think that great content and great ideas matter more than names!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After we have decided on which talk fits best, we will get in touch with you via the contact details you have provided.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>We will contact all persons who applied and let them know what we think about their submission and try our best to give you useful feedback.</p>
            </li>
           </ul>

           <h3>Are there any expenses for me (as a&nbsp;speaker)?</h3>
           <p>No. You will be talking at our nice conference in front of a great audience and we will be covering your expenses!</p>

           <ul>
             <li>
                <p>We will book and pay your preferred&nbsp;connection by plane or train to Cologne and back home.</p>
            </li>
             <li>
                <p>We will book a nice hotel room (including breakfast)&nbsp;close to the venue for you.</p>
            </li>
             <li>
                <p>If you need a pick-up from the airport or train station to and from the hotel, we will happily do so.</p>
            </li>
             <li>
                <p>And last but not least:&nbsp;food and drinks are on us, too!</p>
            </li>
           </ul>
